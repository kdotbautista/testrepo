        The Perception of Speed
      </p>
      <p class="talk-description">Which would you rather have: a website that’s fast or a website that’s perceived as fast? The answer is “Both!” The list of performance best practices is long and well known, but there’s been less focus on the user’s perception of speed. In this presentationSteve Souders provides examples of how the perception of speed is completely independent of actual speed, and techniques for leveraging this perception gap to create websites that feel fast.</p>

          Sweaters as a Service
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">In the 1980's, Nintendo had plans for making a knitting add-on to the NES, with an interface that resembled Mariopaint, but with patterned mittens, sweaters, and scarves as output. Sadly, this product never saw the light of day. Devastated upon hearing this and dreaming about what could have been, a group of Airbnb engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled, using a tutorial from adafruit as a starting point.</p>

          Lies, Damn Lies, and Metrics
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">As evidenced by Heroku's "routergate", to pick a recent example, just having your app instrumented isn't enough to actually know how things are going in the real world. Metrics frequently make people think that everything is understood and under their control, even when that is far from reality. This talk covers common blind spots in instrumentation and metrics setups. It also tries to help inculcate a mindset that cares about the real-world results rather than the dubiously accurate numbers showing up on a web page.</p>

          Being Human: A Collaborative Approach to Making
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">Hey, nerds. How good are you at real collaboration? I don't mean cooperation, where everyone's doing their part. A collaborative solution is more than the sum of those parts. And I don't mean choosing the best idea among the competitors. Collaboration lets us create new ideas that none of us could have come up with on our own. Let's talk about what gets in the way of that kind of juice. Open up, make mistakes, learn, grow, and watch what emerges when we collaborate.</p>

          Angela is an agile developer, coach, facilitator, and instigator. She loves beautiful code that emerges from collaboration, and learning new ways to make it work. When she’s not pairing on tests and the code they inspire, you can find her at conferences speaking about what she’s learned (so far), facilitating kick-ass retrospectives, or discussing the intersection of software and love in open space.

          The Scientific Method of Troubleshooting
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">For software engineers, troubleshooting is one of the toughest and most important skills to develop. When problems arise, a beginning developer's first instincts are to panic and head to StackOverflow. Rather than quick fixes, it's important to seek a deeper understanding of what went wrong. Biologists, chemists, and physicists increase understanding about the world by applying the logical steps of the scientific method to discover solutions to complex problems. Like scientists, developers can learn troubleshooting skills by treating each problem like a mini "science" experiment. In this talk we'll explore how using the scientific method can lead to greater understanding and more viable solutions to complex problems.</p>

          Debugging Tech's Social Justice Issues
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">As developers, we have power to be constructors of social justice. If we are members of the tech community, then we inherit a chain of responsibility for addressing intersections between our work and its sometimes profoundly local effects on communities. We can choose to engage in debugging and fixes. We start by engaging in introspection about the inequities that our industry imposes on groups who have fewer privileges than we have access to. We're going to walk through some of these issues, and review methods for implementing change.</p>

          Exploring Color Spaces with Gesture Tracking and Smart Bulbs
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">RGB, CMYK, HSV, HSL… We have a lot of ways to write code about colors. One thing they all have in common is that they define a space with more than two dimensions. When visualizing or interacting with these spaces we are forced to flatten them to fit on our two-dimensional screens and to interact with them using our puny, two-dimensional pointing devices. The results fail to convey the reasoning behind different modes of color definition. As a result, it can be difficult to develop an intuitive sense of what the numbers that go with these acronyms represent. In turn, communicating about color with others can be a challenge.</p>

          Property-Based Testing for Careful Code
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">Once you've got the hang of Test-Driven Development, you're used to thinking a bit about code before you write it. Unit tests are useful for this, but they're never perfect. And they're sometimes a lot of work to maintain. There's another kind of testing that can drive us to think even harder about our code, with fewer tests. Property-based testing comes out of functional programming, and it can work in any language. This session contrasts typical unit tests with generative testing, then describes techniques for writing extra-serious tests, with examples in Scala and Ruby. See how thinking even harder can make your code even better, and your mind even sharper.</p>

        <p class="talk-description">For the past 50 years the art and craft of programming hasn't changed much. If anything, we have forgotten our history, repeatedly reinventing it poorly. The primitive tools we use today hinder us from building the robust software systems of tomorrow, and the new and shiny programming languages which we adopt every few years seem to systematically ignore decades of research in computer science. As programmers, we spend most of our work days fighting complexity by throwing more complexity at it.</p>

          Hackathon Hellfire: Level Up, Win Money, Change the World?
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">As civic hackathons increase in popularity they present a growing opportunity to contribute as a citizen and an activist in a non-traditional format. A new level of maturity is required for hackathons to have more political and social impact. My presentation will include steps to help make this happen and reasons to become a part of this growing movement: the time in between – how to connect hackathon weekends to a bigger civic movement, the many flavours of hackathons and what to expect of them – app-driven, prize driven, open data driven etc., hackathon personas, the interpersonal piece – the people and personalities that exist in hackathon culture and how to best manage them, why approaching civic hacks like business is best for everyone – how hackathons need to evolve to achieve more social impact.</p>

          Fear Of The Class - A Refactoring Tale
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">This is the story of a brave knight and his struggle for unchaining his village from the claws of The Giant Monolith. Stepwise we walk through his attempts of refactoring a big app to a better object design. While we do discuss patterns and strategies this is more than just ticking off refactoring recipes. This is a pictorial exploration of how we turned a complex frightening code pile into a managable architecture that's fun to work with.</p>

          The 10 Rules Of RobotOps
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">As we build out the "Internet Of Things" with the integration of massive numbers of connected devices, we need to figure out how to keep these new mission-critical systems running. Are the new rules the same as the old rules?  Let us define the term "RobotOps" to mean "DevOps For Robots". RobotOps means applying the various patterns and practices that keep the real-world web operating, in the same fashion that these practices have kept high-traffic internet applications running.  In this talk, by using robots and connected devices, we will demonstrate the 10 "rules" that we think are required for any modern software development effort to be able to keep up with the challenges faced as part of "RobotOps".</p>

          Designing Modern Service Architectures
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">Cloud computing is becoming the primary way large web applications are deployed. The flexibility of these platforms gives us the opportunity to break out of the usual scaling patterns and deliver power precisely where and when we need it. Through practical examples, we'll explore a modern service-oriented application and discover strategies and tools that will help you make the most of the cloud.</p>

          Money, Sex and Evolution
        </p>
        <p class="talk-description">We are all born with a sense of wonder and amazement at the world around us. Many of us just learn to turn it off as we grow older and jaded. I believe this is partly because we don’t understand what goes on in the world around us well enough, and thus we don’t care either. This talk is an attempt to bring back that wonder and sense of discovery of the world around us through the tools of our trade -- programming and analyzing data. It’s hard to explore the whole wide world with just bits and bytes. So if we can’t explore the world we live in, we’ll create our own worlds and explore those — in other words, we’ll use simulations. Simulations are an excellent way of exploring things that we cannot control by simply focusing on those things we can. This enables us to simplify and eventually understand the real world better. In this talk, I'll discuss how Ruby can be used to build a simulated world, bring that to life and explore various facets of that simulated world. I will show how Ruby is not just for developing web applications, it's also an exciting tool for exploration.</p>

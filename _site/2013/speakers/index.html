        <h3>Full Stack Documentation: A holistic approach to documentation, testing, development and deployment.</h3>
        <p>
          Documentation is not just something we should do more of, it's the key to integrating all of the best practices we [try to] follow into a coherent whole, and getting the most value out of every line of code.  We will see how automating deployment means we can easily create a structure for writing fully maintainable documentation for several different audiences, and we will see how this process creates a feedback loop to improve our code and workflow.

        <h3>Leaner, Meaner Design</h3>
        <p>
          After designing and building software for clients on more than 100 products over the last 20 years, it's become painfully obvious that there's no shortage of great ideas for new products. Equally obvious is that starting with a great idea doesn't necessarily mean you’ll wind up with a great product. Almost every wildly successful startup has found said success with a completely different product than they originally set out to build.
        </p>
        <p>
          How have these teams found the secret successful product hiding in the heap of (mostly unused) features their team is furiously designing, building, shipping, and supporting? Sure, you're supposed to get out of the building and talk to customers, but how do you actually do it, and what do you once you have? And what if you got into this whole industry partly because you don't actually like talking to people?

        <h3>Open Sourcing Mental Illness</h3>
        <p>
          In the spirit of open source, I’d like to shine a spotlight on depression. Not because it’s easy, but because it’s important. Mental illness affects many of us, but the stigma attached to it dissuades most people from talking about it openly. That’s not how we make progress. With this talk, I want to do my part.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen, and I’ve been struggling with it my whole life. In this talk, I’ll discuss how it has impacted my work as a developer, husband, and father.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking openly about my own challenges and successes, I hope those struggling with mental illness will learn how to be happier and more productive, and others can better understand how to be helpful and supportive.

        <h3>The History of Women in Programming</h3>
        <p>
          Computer programming was once seen as "women's work." Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Adele Goldberg, and others played pivotal roles in paving the way for today's computing professions. So why then do we see so few women in our community? We'll cover the history of women in computing, possible causes of the gender imbalance, and ideas for how our community can shape a future that includes more women. Co-presented with Jessica Lynn Suttles.

        <h3>Implementing Programmer Anarchy</h3>
        <p>
          Programmer Anarchy is a post Agile process that focuses on empowering programmers by eliminating roles that interfere with domain knowledge and assumption of day to day decisions by the programmers. Originally conceived in a startup environment at Forward Internet Group in London, Programmer Anarchy is now being implemented in a traditional IT shop for an established company: MailOnline, the online newspaper arm of the Daily Mail of London. This discussion will talk about the introduction of Anarchy into a Scrum shop, the training, the transition of roles, and the redesign of HR roles.

He gave the first Agile/XP experience report at OOPSLA in 1999 about an embedded system done in Java, and has mentored many clients in use of objects in Java under an XP process. He has shared the stage at JavaOne with Martin Fowler, acting as his foil, and assisted in XP Immersion sessions with Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Robert Martin. Fred spent a year as a visiting lecturer at N.C. State University teaching Java programming to over 800 undergraduates, with a generous dose of object design, patterns, and XP practices thrown in. Fred joined ThoughtWorks in 2003, delivering yet more projects using agile processes. He has worked with clients in four countries since then, including a tenmonth assignment in India (where he founded ThoughtWorks University), four months of projects in China, and a post in the London office. In 2007, he joined the London Internet advertising firm, Forward, bringing Agile practices to all aspects of the business, leaving to pursue industry change at the end of 2011. He has been writing about the postagile work at Forward under the moniker of Programmer Anarchy. He believes in objects, Lean processes, fun in programming, and the client's successes. He holds a bachelors degree from N. C. State University in Computer Science, and a masters degree from MIT in the Management of Technology. Oh, and he still writes code!

          Computer programming was once seen as "women's work." Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, Adele Goldberg, and others played pivotal roles in paving the way for today's computing professions. So why then do we see so few women in our community? We'll cover the history of women in computing, possible causes of the gender imbalance, and ideas for how our community can shape a future that includes more women. Co-presented with Elise Worthy.

        <h3>Connascence Examined</h3>
        <p>
          Connascence (noun) is defined as (1) the common birth of two or more at the same time; production of two or more together, (2) That which is born or produced with another, or (3) the act of growing together.
        </p>
        <p>
          In software, we are told we should reduce the coupling between our modules so that our software is easier to maintain.  But what is coupling?  Myers (in "Composite/Structured Design") suggests that there are seven levels of coupling, but his nomenclature is developed during the days of Structured programming and does not deal well with objects and classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By identifying and classifying how changes in one portion of a software program can effect other places in the program, connascence attempts to define coupling in terms of ways software can changes.  In this talk we will examine the different types of connascence and come to understand how coupling effects software development.

        <p>
          In the ”Internet of Things” (IoT) vision the physical world blends with virtual one, while machine-to-machine interaction improve our daily life. Clearly, how these virtual objects are exposed to us is critical, so that their user interface must be designed to support the easiness of usage that is driven by the users’ needs, which is different from what machines requires. These two requirements must be solved, and an integrated solution should emerge, if we want to bring the IoT to the 50 billions network that is predicted to became in the next years. In this talk, you will see how these requirements cannot be met by the same communication protocol, as the user interfaces dictates a way of communication that is no suitable for the "machines". We will analyze what are the state-of-art protocols for both machines and users, and finally we will propose a solution to solve this problem.

        <h3>Beautiful Software</h3>
        <p>
          The hallmark of any good software developer is a passion for coding. Passion is rarely enough, however. The best developers treat coding as a craft, and consider all the details that will take the code from "working" to something extensible, maintainable, and readable. Great software developers look at both the big picture as well as the details: Is your code consistent? If I have a new edge case, how difficult is it to fix or add? Have I considered all the various sources of input? If I get hit by a bus tomorrow, will the team carry on?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this session, we'll discuss the choices we make as developers, and how they affect both how we develop and the results we produce -- choices ranging from testing to considering scalability, to re-use with alternate configuration. The goal is to inspire developers to craft beautiful software.

        <h3>How to Write Big Apps</h3>
        <p>
          The Seneca pattern is a way to break your application into pieces so that you can put it back together again in many different ways. You don't have to worry about architecture, database choice, network design, scaling or even which objects to define - you can defer them all! Instead you focus on the "stuff that needs to happen" right from that start.
        </p>
        <p>
          A concrete, production implementation exists in Node.js, and you can also write components in other languages.

        <h3>Designing Cloud Aware Applications</h3>
        <p>
          We can’t keep building applications the same way we’ve always done and expect them to work well on cloud platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud computing has a number of attractive characteristics that solve business and technical problems. It promises elastic scalability, metered consumption, and on-demand self-service. But, those characteristics are not features of infrastructure. They don’t magically appear when you deploy an application to the cloud. These characteristics emerge from creating systems that conform to cloud architecture principles (I outline 7 of them in this talk), and by applying design patterns to maximize those characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we’ve also got to let go of WORA (write once, run anywhere). Clouds offer different features and fail in different ways. Systems need to be engineered to be aware of these peculiarities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this session, Richard urges developers to think about abandoning existing and comfortable patterns and guides them towards new ones that will allow their applications to be more awesome on their chosen cloud.

        <h3>Ruby On Robots Using Artoo: A New Platform For Robotics, Physical Computing, and the Real World Web</h3>
        <p>
          Artoo is a robotics platform that allows you to communicate with several different machines in Ruby programming. Just like writing a line of code for your web application, you are able to write instructive code in Artoo that communicates with the machine. Ron will be demonstrating this with Sphero's and ARdrones.

        <h3>Function and Dysfunction in Engineering-Driven Cultures</h3>
        <p>
          All companies and all teams have implicit beliefs, unspoken rules, unexamined norms, unsurfaced power structures. These form the basis of your culture and inform how you make technical and business decisions. In this talk, we'll explore a framework for understanding how culture really works in engineering-driven companies. We'll deconstruct what "engineering-driven" means; how power dynamics, mythologies and belief systems drive technology selection; how bias functions in team hiring and growth; and how culture moderates friction and function in other parts of the organization. You'll walk away with a better understanding of culture in engineering-driven organizations, and some ways to help build critical consciousness and healthier patterns in your team and company.

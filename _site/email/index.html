<p>Dear Boss,</p>
<p>I've love to attend Distill. It is a developer conference for people like me who are creating and building web and mobile technology. The conference will feature over 30 speakers exploring software development methods, innovative hardware platforms, unique solutions to the problems we face and much more -- all directly applicable to the work that we do every day. The benefits of sending me to Distill are extensive! Attached is a pdf with more information about the conference.  It is on August 7-8 in San Francisco. Thank you!</p>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Your Name
